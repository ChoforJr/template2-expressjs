See: https://pris.ly/prisma-config-env-vars.

Next steps:

1. Install `dotenv`, and add `import "dotenv/config";` to your `prisma.config.ts` file to load environment variables from `.env`.
2. Run `prisma dev` to start a local Prisma Postgres server.
3. Define models in the `schema.prisma` file.
4. Run `prisma migrate dev` to migrate your local Prisma Postgres database.
